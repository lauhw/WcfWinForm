This solution was developed using VS2010 and the purpose of this solution is to learn how to configure the app.config file in both client and server. 

Open the app.config file in the server and the client. Try to comment out some of the settings and run the solution. You will be able to learn the error message when the configuration is not done properly. Please take note that the solution is working if the client app is running on the same box as you are running the WCF server. You need to test the configure with two computers.
